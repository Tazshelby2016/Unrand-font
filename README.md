## Building and using the font
The Unrand font repository contains image files of each individual block as well as a larger image file containing Basic Latin and the other blocks that are incomplete or need review. All individual images are identical in size, so you can use programs like [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) to reorder and trim characters. I designed the images to work with YellowAfterLife's [Pixel Font Converter](https://yal.cc/r/20/pixelfont/). Once set up properly, it will create a *.ttf file.

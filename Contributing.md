#How to contribute to the Unrandomised Pixel font family:
##Modifying the charactersheet:
 * Piskel files hold every saved version of the font. Simply load at Piskelapp.com.
   * BEWARE! The files included far exceed the sites' recommended limits - Overload, crashing, and glitches could occur.
 * The shapes are arbitrary, but the serifs are not.
 * The 'M' determines the size of an Em.
 * Three separate weights are planned: bold, light, and regular.
   * The characters in the regular font (Most current) include chars.
 * See New Piskel.png for characters at each weight
 * No kerning other than the 1 pixel gap at the front of the characters.

##Generating the font
 * This uses https://yal.cc/r/20/pixelfont/.
 * Simply import the charactersheet and the .json file in the repository.
 * Note the 4 character format.
   * Find the inserted characters and add them, following the format.
 * Warning! Some characters may break the program - Watch the output.
 * Save both the .tff and the .json files

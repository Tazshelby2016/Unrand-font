# How to contribute to the Unrandomised Pixel font family:
## Modifying the glyphs:
  * I use Piskel (https://www.piskelapp.com/)
  * I separated characters by their block's name.
  * There must be 4 characters to a row.
## Generating the font sheet
  * I use Tiled (https://www.mapeditor.org/)
## Generating the font
  * I use Pixel Font Converter (https://yal.cc/r/20/pixelfont/)
  * Simply import the charactersheet and the .json file in the repository.
  * Note the 4 character format.
  * Find the inserted characters and add them, following the format.
  * Warning! Some characters may break the program - Watch the output.
  * Save both the .tff and the .json files
